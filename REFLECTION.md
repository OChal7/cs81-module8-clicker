# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Changing the content when click evernt happend helped me understand how elements are updated.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose fun messages that ranged from motivational ones to later ones that were surprised at the amount of cookies clicked.  

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
I forgot to update the display count when incementing so this caused the number in the dispaly to remain the same at 0.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added background color changes at milestones.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/  Is a web game that uses this kind of interaction to give the user points that they get based on the amount of cookeis they click.
